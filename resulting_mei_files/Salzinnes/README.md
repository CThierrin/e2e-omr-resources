# MEI Files Encoding the Music and Text of the Salzinnes Antiphonal (CDN-Hsmu M2149.L4)

Here are the MEI files obtained through the end-to-end OMR workflow in Rodan. 

The naming convention of these files is: ```<siglum>_<folio number>```. 
Example for folio 1r in the [Salzinnes Antiphonal](https://cantus.uwaterloo.ca/source/123723): ```CDN-Hsmu_M2149.L4_001r```

These files will be doubled-checked by Anna de Bakker to guarantee they are correctly encoded.
