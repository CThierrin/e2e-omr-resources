MEI Files Encoding the Music and Text of the Einsiedeln manuscript (CH-E 611)

Here are the MEI files obtained through the end-to-end OMR workflow in Rodan.

The naming convention of these files is: siglum_folio number. Example for folio 1r in the Einsiedeln manuscript: CH-E_611_001r

There are three sets of files:
  
    The files as obtained by the OMR workflow, before being corrected by a user in Neon. These are found the folder ready_for_neon.
    The files corrected by a user in Neon. These are found in the folder processed.
    The same files were then double-checked by an expert (also using the Neon editor). These are found in the folder reviewed.
