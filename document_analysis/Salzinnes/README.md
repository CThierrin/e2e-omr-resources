The models were generated by the `Training model for Patchwise Analysis of Music Document â€“ HPC` job, 
using the images provided in the `training_data` folder. For processing a music document with staff lines and text,
only three models are necessary: one for music symbols, one for staff lines, and one for background (which will include the text).

We used the default values of the settings of this training job:
- `maximum number of samples per label = 10,000`
- `epochs = 15`
- `patch height = 256`
- `patch width = 256`
- `batch size = 16`
- We used the maximum amount of memory allowed: `257 GB`. However, we recommend against this. 
You should try to use the least amount of memory that allows the job to finish (hint: this value is probably around `90GB` or higher).
- It normally takes a bit more than 4 hours to train, so the default setting of `6 hours` is fine.
